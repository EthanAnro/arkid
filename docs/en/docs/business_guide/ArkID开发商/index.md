* Ability to develop and self-research
* Have an ArkID account
* Visit ArkStore

Developers can produce two types of products to the ArkID ecosystem: [ * * ArkID Plugin * * ](./%20插件/) and [**SaaS应用**](./应用/).

## Price rules

### Store payment

The plug-in can only choose the store payment method, and the application can be the store payment method or the in-app payment method.

Whether it's a plug-in or an app, developers can set the price.

Prices are divided into two categories: ** Purchase price ** and ** Rental price **, and the composition of the two prices is the same.

The price contains two elements: and

Unit of market guidance price: X yuan/y person/Z day

* When X = 0, it is considered free
* When y = 0, it is considered unlimited
* When Z = 0, the number of days is considered unlimited

The cost discount can be any two decimal places between 0 and 1.

!!! Notice

Multiple prices can be set to meet different pricing strategies.

### In-app payments

Instead of paying through the store, your app can be paid by the user on your in-app payment page.

In this case, you need to sign relevant cooperation agreements with Longgui, and agree on a good share ratio, which can be settled regularly with Longgui.
