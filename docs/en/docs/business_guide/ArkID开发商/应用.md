#### Custom authentication protocol

Please contact us if your application uses other non-standard protocols.

#### Fill in the account secret instead

If your application cannot be accessed through OIDC for the time being, we also recommend using the method of filling in the account password instead.

Creating an account password filling application is similar to creating an OIDC application. You only need to select AutoFormFill in the protocol configuration in step 3, and select form filling in step 4.

Account password filling is not a single sign-on protocol, but will record the account password of the corresponding site in the browser, and automatically fill in and click login.

If the website uses additional methods such as verification code, it is not applicable to fill in the account password.

#### Promotion link

If the current application does not support the above situations, you can only upload an exclusive promotion link of ArkID, and record the user's subsequent registration, login, payment and other behaviors as the basis for sharing accounts with ArkID.

Usually in this case, the payment will be in the form of internal payment, and you need to contact us.
