# Approval management

## Approve action

Click Create to define the Approval Action.

Once an API is defined as an approval action, all requests to that API are suspended and an approval request is generated. The API request is not released and executed until the approval request is approved. If the request is denied, the API request is canceled.

Each approval action is required to be connected to an approval system, which is used to process the approval request generated by the approval action.

* Click Approval Management > Approval Action in the list menu

## Approval system

The system used to process approval requests.

The plug-in is connected to each approval system, and the plug-in sends the approval request to each approval system and receives the change feedback of the approval request from the approval system.

Click Create to add the configuration of the approval system plug-in. The configuration of each plug-in is different. See the documentation of each plug-in for details.

The processing logic of the default approval system is very simple, that is, the tenant administrator processes the relevant approval request in [Default Request Processing].
