# Plug-in base class

The most basic base class for plug-ins is

The core methods that support hot plugging are ** start() ** and ** stop() **, which call ** load() ** the and ** unload() ** methods respectively. These two methods are used in each plug-in subclass to customize the operations done during installation and uninstallation.

* ** load() ** Is an abstract method, requiring every plug-in to implement.
* Can ** unload() ** also be overloaded. Destroys all registered APIs, events, etc. In the load () process.

Therefore, try to avoid using the kernel API directly in the plug-in, and use the method that begins with ** register ** the encapsulated in the plug-in. When a method of type register is called, the destruction of the relevant operation is already performed in stop and does not need to be done in unload.

Some changes to the content of the page, such as actions related modifications, need to be destroyed as shown in unload.
