# Multilingual

Django-ninja is not compatible with Django's original multilingual interface in the implementation of OpenAPI.

Therefore, ArkID has customized a set of multilingual implementation methods.

Mainly through:

[Arkid. Core. Translation. Gettext _ default] (././ref doc/% 20 kernel API/# arkid. Core. Translation)

The default is "Simplified Chinese".

```py
from django.db import models
from arkid.core.translation import gettext_default as _
from django.apps import AppConfig

app_label = "com_longgui_case"

class CaseApp(AppConfig):
    name = app_label

class CaseModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = app_label

    nickname = models.CharField(verbose_name=_('nickname', '昵称'), max_length=128)
```
