## Function introduction
The approval system is mainly used to process approval requests. Plug-in developers can send approval requests to different third-party systems in the logic of processing approval requests, and the third-party systems can send back the processing results after processing the approval requests

## Realize the idea
* First, create the approval action, specify the interface Path, method and the approval system plug-in responsible for processing

* Intercepting the HTTP Request according to the scanning approval action in the middleware ** arkid.core.approve_request_middleware **,
    1. If an approval action does not create an approval request, create the approval request, distribute ** CREATE_APPROVE_REQUEST ** the event, store the HTTP Request in the approval request and interrupt the HTTP Request
    2. If an approval action has created an approval request, determine the status of the approval request. If the status is passed, continue to execute the HTTP Request. If the status is rejected, interrupt the HTTP Request

* Monitor ** CREATE_APPROVE_REQUEST ** events in the approval system plug-in, and [ create_approve_request ](#arkid.core.extension.approve_system.ApproveSystemExtension.create_approve_request) send the approval request to other third-party systems for processing

* After processing the approval request, other third-party approval systems can return the approval result through the interface

    - Agree to ** Approve the request ** the interface

        - path：/approve_requests/{{request_id}}/pass/
        - method: PUT
        - Handler: pass _ approve _ request _ handler
        - The abstract method needs to be implemented:

    - Deny the ** Approve the request ** interface

        - path：/approve_requests/{{request_id}}/deny/'
        - method: PUT
        - Handler: deny _ approve _ request _ handler
        - The abstract method needs to be implemented:

## Abstract method
* [create_approve_request](#arkid.core.extension.approve_system.ApproveSystemExtension.create_approve_request)
* [deny_approve_request](#arkid.core.extension.approve_system.ApproveSystemExtension.deny_approve_request)
* [pass_approve_request](#arkid.core.extension.approve_system.ApproveSystemExtension.pass_approve_request)
