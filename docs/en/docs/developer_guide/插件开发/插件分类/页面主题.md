# Page theme

!!! Warning "Caution"
    1. The effect of the function of changing the theme on the page is not satisfactory. Please use it with caution.
    2. The front-end staff of this module is actively developing and testing, please wait patiently, and it is expected to show the complete effect this month.

## Guidelines for use

  Tenant administrators can add and delete themes on the `租户管理 => 主题设置` page. When creating and adding themes, priority parameters will be filled in, and front-end reading will respond according to the order of priority. If you want to update or delete the theme, you need to refresh the page before you can see the change of the theme of the front-end page.
