## Function introduction
Before displaying the ArkID login page (password, mobile phone, etc.), the system will traverse the methods provided ** authenticate ** by automatic login plug-ins (such as keberos). If one of the plug-ins is successfully authenticated, you can immediately log in to ArkID.

## Realize the idea
* Before entering the ArkID system, the interface will be called ** /api/v1/login/ **, in the processing function of this interface, the URL Query Params and ** /api/v1/login_process/ ** the rendering ** templates/login_enter.html ** template as parameters will be returned to the browser, and the browser will execute the JavaScript code in the template.
Judge whether there is a token in the URL Query Parmas, if there is, save it to the local storage, if not, take the token in the localStorage, and finally, Redirect the browser to ** /api/v1/login_process ** with token and URL Query Parmas as query parameters
* After entering ** /api/v1/login_process/ ** the processing function of the interface, it will judge whether there is a token in the query parameter. If there is a token, after verifying that the token is valid, if there is next in the query parameter, it will be redirected directly to the URL pointed by next. If not, it will be redirected to the front-end login page; If there is no token or the token is invalid,
Then distribute the AUTO _ LOGIN event and traverse the result returned from the event distribution. If one of the automatic authentication plug-ins is successfully authenticated and returns user, refresh the user token and redirect to ** /api/v1/login/ ** with token. If all the automatic authentication plug-ins fail, redirect to the front-end login pack
