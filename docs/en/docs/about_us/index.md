## Domestic software industry is large but not strong

Although China's software industry started late, up to now, we have nearly 10 trillion market size and nearly 8 million employees. However, the R & D part of domestic software has always been in the low-end position of the relevant industrial chain.

Any market or business, in essence, the source of its formation is the needs of customers. Software companies, as Party B, have completely different characteristics in meeting customer needs.

In the software market, customers can be divided into several levels according to their ability to pay: government and institutions, large state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, medium-sized enterprises, small and micro enterprises, and individuals.

** The first type of customers-government and public institutions ** Because the central government encourages and supports the information industry and gives these institutions sufficient space in the budget, the government and public institutions have strong payment ability and occupy a dominant position in the whole market. Supported by local governments and institutions, a large number of local software enterprises have been rapidly trained in the early stage of the development of the software industry, laying the foundation for the software industry. However, due to its stable customer relationship, it lacks enthusiasm for R & D investment. And because of its strong regional nature, they will fight separately. At the same time, in order to reduce costs, such software companies are more willing to use foreign mature business solutions, which indirectly forces customers to purchase some expensive overseas software products.

** The second type of customers-large state-owned enterprises and private enterprises ** Its market-oriented mode of operation is less affected by policy in terms of demand. However, due to the huge internal enterprise, detailed division of labor, complex and unique business processes, such customers'demand for software shows a high degree of customization, which can not reduce costs by purchasing existing products, but can only be customized by organizing development teams. Around the demand of these large enterprises to reduce the cost of employment, a number of software companies have been born, which can be regarded as technology outsourcing enterprises of large enterprises. The internal development teams of large enterprises exist for the purpose of meeting the application requirements such as enterprise processes, and tend to use conservative technical solutions, and technological innovation and R & D are not their priority elements.

** The third type of customer-the edge department of a medium-sized enterprise or a large enterprise ** Their scale can not support the cost of customized software, often buy ready-made products, and then build their business processes, they are the mainstream consumers of domestic software products. In the market of this customer group, there is a fierce competition among software companies. Except for a few areas with strong professional or policy barriers, one or two strong companies can be produced, and the homogeneity of other types of software is serious. Software companies also have relatively weak internal intellectual property protection for software, and may use pirated software and open source code without following the rules. This approach helps software companies with a certain market position to continue to consolidate their market position and stifle later innovators. In the absence of pressure from upstarts, vested interests tend to invest more resources in maintaining their business relationships than in technology.

** The fourth type of customers-small and micro enterprises ** They have a large number, relatively weak payment ability, and can only use free or very low price rental software, which constitutes the status quo of the domestic SaaS software market. SaaS software companies are also unable to get healthy cash flow, resulting in their stagnation at the R & D level. Because of their professional products, SaaS enterprises can not follow the example of personal software through e-commerce, games, advertising and other business models. Once SaaS enterprises want to expand into the field of medium-sized enterprise customers, they have to face the fierce competition situation mentioned above, and most start-up SaaS companies can not afford this price. Even if a few SaaS companies have capital support and grab a piece of meat from the existing market, they will still fall into the embarrassing situation that business can not expand further and capital can not get effective returns, and enterprises still have to return to the old road of having to invest a lot of resources to maintain market relations. In this case, the R & D department becomes a cost center rather than a profit center. SaaS enterprises are mostly start-ups, and their core backbones are mostly technical products and other practitioners. They have the will to make technological progress, and if they have the opportunity, they will be the backbone of technological progress.

** The fifth category is personal software. ** By attracting users free of charge and realizing traffic through e-commerce, games and advertising, this is the home of Internet enterprises. However, Internet giants pursue market share and profit returns, hoarding a large number of technical talents, but innovation, especially technological innovation, contains greater risks, while short-term capital returns are difficult to measure, leading to large Internet enterprises will be conservative, focusing on the commercial part of the main business.

---------------

The result that the domestic software industry is always at the low end of the industrial chain is that the profit growth of the whole industry is not created by technological innovation, but depends heavily on the scale of manpower, which needs to expand the scale of labor and extend the working hours. This situation brings real software producers and workers, including products, design, development, testing and so on, and can not get the income growth brought by the development of the industry.

It can be seen that the existing business model (production relations) of the entire software industry has become a constraint to technological progress (productivity development). There is a possibility, or a trend, a force, to reshape the relations of production (industrial revolution) to meet the needs of the development of productive forces.

Through the analysis of the domestic software industry, we can find that there are these problems:

* Lack of a market for the free flow of resources
* Software producers are driven by time rather than technological innovation, and the expansion of business scale depends on the number of personnel.
* Serious homogeneity of products leads to malicious competition
* Small and micro enterprises have poor payment ability and low willingness to pay.
* The monopoly of the Internet platform
* Weak protection of intellectual property rights


After eliminating the factors that are not conducive to technological progress, enterprises or individuals involved in production and trading are reconnected as new market opportunities, and the liberation of technology as a factor can become a new driving force to promote innovation and productivity development, and achieve industrial change.

## To promote the overall transformation of the software industry, we need to change the production relations and create new possibilities for connection.

The change of taxi market provides us with ideas. By integrating drivers and passengers on the same platform to complete transactions directly, taxi APP eliminates information barriers and successfully promotes industry changes through market changes. If the software industry can connect consumers and producers and establish a national software market, it is believed that the same effect can be achieved.

Unlike the taxi market where the service provider is the driver, the software industry is much more complex. Software products and services are faced with ever-changing personalized needs, and need a lot of people to cooperate to complete. This means that organizing producers is a necessary condition for the formation of a unified market.

Nowadays, software producers are scattered in various enterprises, whether it is product, design, development, the interaction between them is very limited.

In the organization of producers, the relatively mature software market in Europe and the United States is a good reference. If an enterprise wants to implement an IT project, it often first docks with consulting enterprises, which will dock or tap the demand, and then the professional implementation enterprises will be responsible for the implementation of the demand. Such implementation enterprises will purchase all kinds of basic software upstream, including development tools, operating systems, databases and so on. Implementation enterprises can also trade with each other, including functional modules and mature products. After the development is completed, the professional testing enterprises are responsible for the acceptance.

Such industrial chain division of labor, so that the implementation of customer-oriented enterprises is no longer a simple human sea tactics. Although people are still the key factor, at least it gets rid of the situation that software development is just manual labor.

There is no such structure in China, the core reason is that the cost advantage brought by the overseas division of labor is not equal to the low labor cost in China. In this regard, only by further refining the division of labor and expanding the cost advantages brought by industrial chain cooperation, can producers move towards an interdependent industrialized mode of production. If the interests of producers are the same, they can get rid of the competition of product homogeneity.

An advantage that is also different from foreign countries is that there are enough industrial groups in China to support a more fine-grained industrial division of labor. From this point of view, China has more advantages than Europe and the United States to complete industrial transformation more deeply.

Software products have the characteristic of almost zero replication cost. Under the combined effect of industrial chain division of labor and unified market, it is easy to enrich the software market with low price and large quantity as the selling point, serving small and micro enterprises, and even expand to the field of personal software. In this regard, there are now a large number of WeChat applets that sell for tens or hundreds of yuan, and this segment of the software market has already set a good example.

To sum up, in order to make the software industry as a whole take a step forward to change, to solve the above problems, we need to promote the following points:

* Establish a national market for software products so that resources can flow freely.
* Establish a software development market based on division of labor and cooperation, such as consulting, R & D, design, testing and other professional enterprises.
* Strengthen the links between upstream producers in the software industry chain and turn competition into mutual assistance, such as the establishment of a source code trading market.
* Strengthen the cooperation of software products at the sales end and lower the threshold of agency.
* Respect each other's labor achievements and strengthen the protection of innovative intellectual property rights

Each of the above aspects seems difficult to achieve in the short term, but we can still see some technological trends, like buds arching out of the ground, causing cracks in these monolithic elements to penetrate into new changes. For example

1. Unified identity

    With OIDC as the representative, a common standard protocol for unified identity authentication has been established, which has laid the foundation for reducing the cost of enterprise management software and realizing the vision of digitalization, resulting in a series of IAM/IDaaS enterprises building unified identity services.

2. Cloud native

    Cloud native technologies represented by docker and k8s can greatly reduce the difficulty and cost of operation and maintenance implementation, and also draw a clearer boundary in the division of it management and operation and maintenance, which provides a technical basis for the unified software market. There are a number of excellent technology-based enterprises in China that build enterprise cloud platforms based on cloud native technology.

3. Low Code
   
    With the rapid development and popularization of Web technology represented by Vue, the excellent cross-platform capability of Web has brought about tremendous changes in the software development process, and many innovative enterprises have begun to actively explore the field of low code or no code. Although in the exploratory stage, the concept of low code provides a feasible direction for further refining the division of labor and reshaping the industrial chain.

4. Open Source Movement
   
    The open source communities of Python, Go and other languages are challenging the enterprise software market based on Java and. Net. The technology enterprises with open source as the business model are rapidly promoting the popularization of technology, breaking the technological monopoly of large enterprises. At the same time, they have also established standards, promoting the integration of industrial chains and becoming the core force.

In terms of the state's regulation and protection of the industry, we also see that the government has introduced a series of measures to encourage the industry. Of course, it is not enough to rely solely on government power. The occurrence of industrial revolution must be the result of the joint promotion of many industrial people, especially SaaS enterprises, as a new force, unite, cooperate closely, form an industrial chain, grow together and promote change together.

## In the process of change, the entry point of Longgui Science and Technology
Longgui Technology is trying to do something, and ArkID developed by Longgui Technology is a core project carrying these ideas. On the surface, ArkID is an IDaaS product that may look similar to a general unified identity product. But the difference is:

1. Open source
   
    The reason for open source is to share our products with all industry people. Developing any product requires an identity module, and using ArkID directly saves development time. ArkID supports private deployment, and you can use it directly, either for your own use or as a standalone IDaaS site.

2. Plug-in and set up a plug-in store
   
    ArkID relies on plug-ins for most of its functionality. The flexibility of plug-ins can meet the various personalized needs of users and reduce the implementation cost. All ArkID users can upload their own plug-ins to the plug-in store to share or sell with partners, and implementers can purchase these plug-ins directly at a lower cost than direct development.

3. Built-in SaaS app store
   
    ArkID has a built-in app store. Developers can create the entrance of SaaS applications through the official IDaaS platform. Whether ArkID users are privately deployed or using tenants, they can directly log in and use the SaaS software in the App Store with their own ArkID account. Share users with ArkID's co-developers in this way.

4. Open Proxy Rule

    Whether you are an individual or an enterprise, using a private deployment or a tenant, if you register an ArkID account through any channel, you will automatically become an agent of ArkID, selling plug-ins and all products in the App Store at an agent price.

5. Low-code development framework
   
    If you are a programmer and are interested in looking at ArkID's code, you may find this: We have incorporated some ideas of low-code development into the development of ArkID and implemented these ideas in the way of development framework. This is also an attempt to promote a more fine-grained industrial division of labor. If you are interested, please contact us.
