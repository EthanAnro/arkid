# This is the runtime configuration which stored in K8s cluster. Modifications 
# to the development configuration will take effect the next time you enter
# the DevMode, and modification will share with all those who use this cluster.
#
# If you want to customized personal configuration, you can create a configuration
# file named config.yaml in the root directory of your project under the
# folder .nocalhost (/.nocalhost/config.yaml). It will become part of your 
# project, you can easily share configuration with other developers, or
# develop on any other devices using this personal configuration.
#
# Tips: You can paste the configuration follow into 
# c:\Users\tmac\Desktop\arkid\.nocalhost\config.yaml
#
# In addition, if you want to config multi service in same config.yaml, or use
# the Server-version of Nocalhost, you can also configure under the definition 
# of the application, such as:
# https://nocalhost.dev/docs/config/config-deployment-quickstart
